# Newgrounds Proxy Reimagined

<cy>NOTE: Since 11th-12th of June 2025, Geometry Dash servers started using their own audio proxy</c>. They will likely offer the same or faster speeds than this mod, and it is recommended that you <cj>compare the differences</c>, and <cr>disable this mod</c>, unless songs download faster with the mod.

Currently, this mod is mostly useful for people who are <cr>completely blocked</c> from downloading songs, as it will help to bypass the block.

-----

This is a remake of [Newgrounds Proxy](https://github.com/relativemodder/newgrounds-proxy), the original creator hasn't updated the mod in a long time and allowed me to port it to the latest GD version.

Changes from the original mod:

* Rewrote the code, improved the performance
* Added ability to set a custom URL and self-host
* Server made in rust

## Credits

* Relative, for making the [original mod](https://github.com/relativemodder/newgrounds-proxy)
