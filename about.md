# Newgrounds Proxy Reimagined

Redirects all song downloads to a custom cache server that uses Cloudflare, yielding in significantly improved song download speeds if a different person has downloaded this song before (with this mod installed). That means the more you use this mod, the better it gets :)

This is a remake of [Newgrounds Proxy](https://github.com/relativemodder/newgrounds-proxy), the original creator hasn't updated the mod in a long time and allowed me to port it to the latest GD version.

Changes from the original mod:

* Rewrote the code, improved the performance
* Added ability to set a custom URL and self-host
* Server made in rust

## Credits

* Relative, for making the [original mod](https://github.com/relativemodder/newgrounds-proxy)
