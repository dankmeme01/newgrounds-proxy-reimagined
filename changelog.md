# 1.0.2

Around 11th or 12th of June, RobTop <cy>switched most songs</c> to be on a different domain (`ngfiles-proxy.b-cdn.net` instead of `audio.ngfiles.com`) and since then this mod has been <cr>broken</c> due to that.

This update <cg>fixes</c> this issue, redirecting all requests from that domain too.

**BUT, please keep a few things in mind**. RobTop's new audio proxy is also <cg>*very fast*</c>, and is likely going to be faster than using this mod. However, many people have had issues <cr>downloading songs altogether</c> from the new domain, and this mod should fix these issues. If you can download songs fine without the mod, I recommend you to <cj>test the difference</c> between having the mod enabled and disabled, and see what is better for you.

# 1.0.1

~~Try to use a different domain to bypass the block in russia~~

(this claim was incorrect and likely did not actually fix anything)
